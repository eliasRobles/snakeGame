# Description
This project it's a Snake game in Python.

- It is possible to play using the keys:
    - a = right.
    - d = left.
    - w = up.
    - s = down.
    
- Every time it collides with a red dot, the pointer's tail grows, and the delay increases.

- Every time you hit a red dot, your score increases.

- If when the user loses their Score is greater than the Record, then the Record is replaced with the user's Score, thus creating a new record.

- Ways to lose:
    - Hit an edge.
    - Hit with the tail.
